# Predicting Student Percentage Based on Study Hours

This project involves predicting the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours. It is a simple linear regression task as it deals with only two variables: the number of study hours and the corresponding percentage.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project can be found at (http://bit.ly/w-data). This dataset contains two columns:

- **Hours**: The number of study hours.
- **Scores**: The corresponding percentage scores achieved by the students.

## Tools and Technologies

You can use various tools and technologies to perform this analysis and build the predictive model. Some commonly used options include:

- **Python**: Utilizing libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn to perform data manipulation, analysis, and build the regression model.
- **R**: Using R and packages like ggplot2 and lm() for data analysis and linear regression.
- **SAS Enterprise Miner**: Employing SAS Enterprise Miner for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Feel free to choose the tool that you are most comfortable with or explore new ones as per your preferences and requirements.

## Problem Statement

The main objective of this project is to predict the percentage score a student is likely to achieve based on the number of hours they study per day. The problem can be framed as follows:

- **Input**: The number of study hours (independent variable).
- **Output**: Predicted percentage score (dependent variable).

## Sample Solution

To see a sample solution for this problem, you can refer to the following link: [Sample Solution](https://bit.ly/2HXiGGI)

## Usage

You can use the provided dataset and code from the sample solution to perform your own analysis and predictions. Here's how to get started:

1. Download the dataset from [http://bit.ly/w-data](http://bit.ly/w-data).
2. Use the chosen tool or technology (Python, R, SAS, etc.) to load and preprocess the data.
3. Build a linear regression model to predict the student's percentage based on study hours.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
5. Use the trained model to make predictions for specific study hour values, such as the example mentioned in the problem statement: "What will be the predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/day?"

Feel free to customize and adapt the code and analysis to your specific needs and preferences.
